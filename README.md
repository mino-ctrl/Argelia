# Hello, I'm Mino 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a passionate teen developer with a strong interest in technology, coding, and problem-solving. I love building things from the ground up and continuously learning new skills to expand my toolkit.

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I started coding at an early age, and since then, I’ve gained proficiency in several programming languages. My focus is on creating efficient and user-friendly applications, from web development to software engineering. I enjoy taking on challenges and pushing my limits to become a better developer every day.

### 🔧 My Skills
Here are the programming languages and technologies I’m skilled in:

- **Python**: My go-to language for quick prototyping and automation.
- **Java**: I enjoy working on object-oriented projects and exploring its versatility.
- **C++**: I use C++ for system-level programming and learning about memory management.
- **HTML & CSS**: Creating visually appealing, responsive websites is one of my favorite things to do.
- **SQL**: Designing and managing databases with SQL is crucial for full-stack development.
- **PHP**: I also work with PHP to build dynamic websites and server-side applications.

### 🌱 Current Focus
I’m currently working on improving my skills in **web development** and **algorithm design**. I’m also learning more about **backend development** to build scalable systems.
